            <h1>Reduce the environmental impacts of cities</h1>
            <p>Target 11.6 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims to reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities by 2030, focusing on air quality and municipal waste management. This target is monitored through two primary indicators:

                Indicator 11.6.1: Proportion of municipal solid waste collected and managed in controlled facilities out of total municipal waste generated, by cities.
                
                Indicator 11.6.2: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population-weighted).
                
                Indicator 11.6.1: Municipal Solid Waste Management
                
                Effective waste management is crucial for minimizing cities' environmental footprints. In 2022, the global average municipal solid waste (MSW) collection rate in cities was 82%, with 55% of this waste managed in controlled facilities. However, disparities exist across regions; for instance, sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania have MSW collection rates below 60%. Uncollected waste contributes to plastic pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and public health risks.

                 This expansion has improved data collection, but challenges remain in low-income regions.
                
                Challenges and Initiatives
                
                Achieving Target 11.6 requires addressing several challenges:
                
                Data Collection and Standardization: Inconsistent data collection methods hinder accurate assessments. Initiatives like the Waste Wise Cities Tool provide standardized methodologies to improve data reliability. 
                (UNSTATS.UN.ORG)
                
                Resource Allocation: Limited resources in developing regions impede progress in waste management and air quality monitoring. International support and investment are essential to build local capacities.
                
                Policy Implementation: Effective policies are vital for sustainable urban development. Collaborative efforts among governments, organizations, and communities are necessary to implement and enforce environmental regulations.
                
                Conclusion
                
                Reducing the environmental impact of cities is vital for sustainable development. While progress has been made in waste collection and air quality monitoring, significant efforts are needed to address regional disparities and ensure all cities can achieve the targets set for 2030.

            <h1>Provide access to safe and inclusive green and public spaces</h1>
            <p>Target 11.7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims to "provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities" by 2030. Progress toward this target is measured using two indicators:

                Indicator 11.7.1: Average Share of Built-up Area as Open Space for Public Use
                
                This indicator assesses the proportion of urban areas designated as open public spaces accessible to all individuals, regardless of sex, age, or disability status. It focuses on the availability and accessibility of such spaces within cities. 
                (UNSTATS.UN.ORG)
                
                Indicator 11.7.2: Proportion of Persons Victimized by Harassment
                
                This indicator measures the percentage of individuals who have experienced physical or sexual harassment in the past 12 months, disaggregated by sex, age, disability status, and the location of the incident. It aims to capture the prevalence of harassment in various settings, including public spaces, workplaces, and educational institutions. 
                (UNSTATS.UN.ORG)
                
                Challenges in Data Collection and Reporting
                
                Accurately measuring these indicators presents several challenges:
                
                Indicator 11.7.1: Variations in defining and categorizing public spaces across different cities and countries can lead to inconsistencies in data collection. Additionally, the lack of standardized methodologies for measuring accessibility and inclusivity further complicates accurate assessment.
                
                Indicator 11.7.2: Underreporting of harassment incidents is a significant issue, often due to social stigma, fear of retaliation, or lack of trust in authorities. Cultural differences in understanding and defining harassment can also affect the reliability of collected data.
                
                Initiatives to Enhance Data Accuracy
                
                To address these challenges, several initiatives have been implemented:
                
                For Indicator 11.7.1: Organizations like UN-Habitat have developed guidelines and tools to assist cities in accurately measuring and reporting the extent of public spaces. These resources aim to standardize data collection methods and promote best practices in urban planning. 
                (UNHABITAT.ORG)
                
                For Indicator 11.7.2: International bodies such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) are working to harmonize survey instruments and methodologies to improve the comparability and reliability of data on harassment. Efforts are also being made to encourage reporting and support victims through awareness campaigns and policy reforms. 
                (UNSTATS.UN.ORG)
                
                Conclusion
                
                Achieving Target 11.7 requires concerted efforts to improve the availability of safe, inclusive, and accessible public spaces while simultaneously addressing issues related to harassment. Strengthening data collection and reporting mechanisms is crucial for monitoring progress and implementing effective interventions to create more inclusive and secure urban environments.

            <h1>Strong national and regional development planning</h1>
            <p>Target 11.a of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims to "support positive economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning." Progress toward this target is measured by Indicator 11.a.1, which tracks the number of countries that have national urban policies or regional development plans that:

                (a) Respond to population dynamics
                
                (b) Ensure balanced territorial development
                
                (c) Increase local fiscal space
                
                Global Adoption of National Urban Policies
                
                As of 2015, 142 countries had established or were developing national urban policies, encompassing approximately 75% of the world's urban population. 
                (SDGS.UN.ORG)
                 These policies are pivotal in coordinating urbanization processes to promote sustainable development.
                
                Challenges in Data Availability
                
                Despite the widespread adoption of urban policies, comprehensive data on how these policies address the specific criteria outlined in Indicator 11.a.1—such as responsiveness to population dynamics, balanced territorial development, and enhancement of local fiscal capacities—remains limited. This gap underscores the need for improved monitoring and reporting mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of these policies in achieving sustainable urban development.
                
                The New Urban Agenda
                
                In 2016, global leaders adopted the New Urban Agenda, a framework that sets standards for sustainable urban development and emphasizes the integration of all sectors in urban planning. This agenda highlights the interconnectedness of sustainable urbanization with job creation, improved quality of life, and environmental protection. 
                (UNHABITAT.ORG)
                
                Key Components of the New Urban Agenda:
                
                National Urban Policies: Encourages the development of policies that integrate urbanization into national development strategies.
                
                Urban Legislation and Regulations: Promotes legal frameworks to support sustainable urban development.
                
                Urban Planning and Design: Advocates for inclusive and effective planning practices.
                
                Local Economy and Municipal Finance: Focuses on strengthening local economies and financial systems.
                
                Local Implementation: Emphasizes the role of local authorities in executing urban development initiatives.
                
                By aligning national and regional development plans with the principles of the New Urban Agenda, countries can enhance the positive linkages between urban, peri-urban, and rural areas, thereby advancing sustainable development goals.

            <h1>Implement policies for inclusion, resource efficiency and disaster risk reduction</h1>
            <p>Target 11.b of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed to "substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters, and develop and implement... holistic disaster risk management at all levels" by 2020. 
                (INDICATORS.REPORT)
                 This target is measured through two indicators:
                
                Indicator 11.b.1: "Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030."
                
                Indicator 11.b.2: "Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies."
                
                Progress and Challenges
                
                As of 2023, local-level risk governance has improved, with 106 countries reporting having local disaster risk reduction strategies aligned with national strategies. On average, 72% of local governments in these countries have such strategies in place. 
                (SDGS.UN.ORG)
                
                However, several challenges hinder the full implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction:
                
                Data Collection and Reporting: Inconsistent and unstructured data collection impedes effective disaster loss reporting. 
                (REPOSITORY.LIBRARY.NOAA.GOV)
                
                Capacity Constraints: Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and other vulnerable regions often lack the capacity to strengthen resilience, making them susceptible to disasters that can erase decades of development gains. 
                (UN.ORG)
                
                Resource Limitations: Limited financial and technical resources constrain the development and implementation of comprehensive disaster risk reduction strategies. 
                (UNDRR.ORG)
                
                Addressing these challenges requires enhanced international cooperation, capacity-building initiatives, and the allocation of resources to support vulnerable regions in implementing effective disaster risk reduction strategies.
